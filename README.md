# Cat vs Dog Classification Using CNN

**Project Overview**:  
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to create a binary image classifier that can determine whether a given image contains a cat or a dog. The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, two popular deep learning libraries, to leverage their powerful tools for building and training neural networks.

The dataset used in this project is a subset of the Kaggle [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats), containing labeled images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on this dataset to predict the class of new, unseen images.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
Before feeding the images into the CNN model, several preprocessing steps are performed:
- **Image Resizing**: Each image is resized to a consistent size of 64x64 pixels to ensure uniform input dimensions for the model.
- **Normalization**: The pixel values of the images are scaled to the range [0, 1] by dividing each pixel by 255. This normalization helps the model converge faster during training.
- **Augmentation**: For the training set, data augmentation techniques such as **shear transformation**, **zooming**, and **horizontal flipping** are applied to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

### 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture:
The CNN model used in this project consists of several layers that are designed to automatically learn spatial hierarchies from input images:

- **Convolutional Layers (Conv2D)**: These layers apply convolutional filters to the input images. The filters scan the image to extract features such as edges, textures, and more complex patterns. The first convolutional layer has 32 filters, and it uses the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model.

- **Max Pooling Layers (MaxPool2D)**: After each convolutional layer, a max-pooling layer is applied to downsample the feature maps and reduce the spatial dimensions. This helps to decrease computational load and control overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model.

- **Flattening**: After the convolutional and pooling layers, the multi-dimensional feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector, which is used as input to the fully connected layers.

- **Fully Connected Layers (Dense)**: The flattened vector is passed through fully connected (dense) layers. The first dense layer contains 128 units and uses the ReLU activation function. This layer allows the network to learn high-level abstractions of the features.

- **Output Layer**: The output layer consists of a single unit with a **sigmoid** activation function. This is used to output a probability value between 0 and 1. If the output is closer to 1, the image is classified as a "dog"; if it is closer to 0, the image is classified as a "cat".

### 3. Training:
The model is compiled using the **Adam optimizer**, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. The loss function used for training is **binary crossentropy**, which is ideal for binary classification problems. During training, the model is evaluated based on **accuracy**, which measures the percentage of correct predictions on the test set.

### 4. Evaluation:
After training the model, its performance is evaluated on the test set of images. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and generalization, meaning the model should classify new, unseen images accurately.

## Model Performance:
The model's accuracy can vary based on the size of the dataset, the quality of the images, and the architecture of the neural network. During training, the model learns to identify distinct features of cats and dogs, such as facial structures, body shape, and fur texture. Once trained, the model can be used to classify new images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the power of deep learning and CNNs in solving image classification problems. By utilizing a dataset of labeled cat and dog images, a CNN model can learn to distinguish between these two classes based on their visual features. This approach can be applied to other binary classification tasks and adapted for more complex datasets with more categories.

The model can be further improved by:
- Increasing the size of the dataset for better generalization.
- Experimenting with different CNN architectures, such as adding more layers or using pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

With these improvements, the model can be optimized to perform even better on new data.
